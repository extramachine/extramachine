## Getting set up with GitHub and Ren'py

### 1. Get access to the repository
* Make a GitHub account
* Send me your GitHub username
* I'll add you to the repo and you should get an email with a link to it

### 2. Clone the repository
* Download GitHub Desktop
* In the repository, click the green "Code" button and copy this URL

* Return to the main Ren'py screen
* The project should show up on the left. If you have it selected and click Launch Project, you should be able to play through the game.

### 4. Getting the most recent version
From now on if you want to pull the latest version of the project, you can go to GitHub Desktop and click Fetch Origin at the top. That's it!
