## Getting set up with GitHub and Ren'py

### 1. Get access to the repository
* Make a GitHub account
* Send me your GitHub username
* I'll add you to the repo and you should get an email with a link to it

### 2. Clone the repository
* Download GitHub Desktop
* In the repository, copy this URL (make sure that HTTPS is selected)
* In GitHub Desktop go to File -> Clone repository...
* Go to the URL tab
* Paste the URL you copied from GitHub
* Choose where you want the files to go

### 3. Run the project
* Download Ren'py
* In Ren'py go to Preferences (in the bottom right) -> General -> Projects directory
* Choose the folder that you put the project in
* Return to the main Ren'py screen
* The project should show up on the left. If you have it selected and click Launch Project, you should be able to play through the game.

### 4. Getting the most recent version
From now on if you want to pull the latest version of the project, you can go to GitHub Desktop and click Fetch Origin at the top. That's it!
